# Parallax Project

Hello there! In this project, I have developed a website demonstrating the parallax effect which includes a fixed image in the background and a fixed image on the foreground which are kept one over another to demonstrate a 3-D effect.

Basically, the Scrolling effect is where background images move at a different speed than the foreground images creating a 3-D like view for the end user.

This website is built with HTML & CSS concepts only using different-different properties of CSS for designing like Perspective, Z-index, Background properties and more.
