A parallax website includes fixed images in the background that are kept in place and the user can scroll down the page to see different parts of the image. In this basic project, I am creating a parallax webpage using HTML and CSS. I have used basic tags of HTML like div, paragraph, and heading to write our content and will use CSS to align and beautify our basic HTML design.

Basically, the Scrolling effect is where background images move at a different speed than the foreground images creating a 3-D like view for the end user.
